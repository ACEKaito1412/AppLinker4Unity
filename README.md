# AppLinker4Unity

**AppLinker4Unity** is a Unity Android plugin (AAR) that allows you to fetch list of installed applications on a device, get app icons, names and perform actions such as opening the app or navigating to its settings page ‚Äî that you can use on your Unity UI.

I've use this on one of my repo [Simple Launcher](https://github.com/ACEKaito1412/SimpleLauncher).
